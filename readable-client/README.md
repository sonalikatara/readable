## User Story

Leverage ​the ​strengths ​of ​Redux ​to ​build ​a ​“Readable” ​application ​where ​users ​can ​post ​text ​content ​and
comment ​on ​each ​other's ​posts. ​You’ll ​build ​this ​dynamic ​application ​from ​scratch ​while ​combining ​the ​state
management ​features ​of ​Redux ​with ​the ​declarative ​component ​model ​from ​React. ​When ​complete, ​you’ll
be ​able ​to ​submit ​your ​own ​posts, ​comment ​on ​existing ​posts, ​and ​edit ​and ​delete ​posts ​and ​comments.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/).
